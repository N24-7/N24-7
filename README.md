## 🚀 What Drives Me

- 🤖 Creating smart agents that can **learn & adapt**
- 🎮 Building games that combine fun with **AI logic**
- 🧠 Diving deep into **Reinforcement Learning** & **Agent-based systems**

> “I believe AI is not just about automation — it's about building minds that can understand, decide, and grow.”
